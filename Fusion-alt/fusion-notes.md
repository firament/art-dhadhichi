click on "Download" button under Fusion

goes to page

with the message
"Thank you for downloading Autodesk Fusion
If your download does not begin automatically, please try again."

Download does not start, even after 15 minutes.
Clicking on the "please try again." link brings me to 
https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/appstream

and from then on it is a dead end. It stays on the same page and no download ever begins.
