## Notes
### Comparison
| Use Case / Need                             | Recommended Tool        | Why It Stands Out                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parametric 3D CAD, scripting                | **FreeCAD**             | Python extensibility, offline use                        |
| Lightweight parametric & mechanical sim     | **SolveSpace**          | Easy to learn, good for assemblies and mechanism design  |
| Script-based precise modeling               | **OpenSCAD**            | Excellent for programmable designs                       |
| High-quality rendering & technical modeling | **BRL‑CAD**             | Powerful CSG with advanced visualization and ray tracing |
| Simple 2D drafting workflows                | **LibreCAD** / **QCAD** | Efficient for drawings and sketches                      |
| Collaborative, web-based CAD                | **Onshape**             | No install, similar to Fusion 360’s parametric tools     |

### Recommendations Summary
- Use FreeCAD if you need a versatile, offline-friendly CAD tool for both 2D and 3D modeling.
- Try SolveSpace for quick, lightweight designs with parametric control.
- Go with OpenSCAD for programmer-style precision and reproducible modeling.
- Choose BRL‑CAD for professional engineering models and high-quality rendering capabilities.
- Opt for LibreCAD or QCAD if your focus is exclusively 2D drafting.
- Consider Onshape if you want a Fusion-like experience with cloud collaboration via browser.

### Parametric design
If parametric design is your priority and you're looking for the easiest learning curve on Linux, here's a focused breakdown based on your preferences:

| Software       | Parametric Support | Learning Curve         | Best For                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **SolveSpace** | Yes                | Easiest, visual GUI    | Fast, intuitive parametric modeling for beginners |
| **OpenSCAD**   | Yes                | Moderate, scripting    | Programmers who want precise control via code     |
| **FreeCAD**    | Yes                | Steep, multi‑workbench | Deep functionality, complex modeling workflows    |

### PCB Design

| Tool           | PCB Support                   | Notes                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SolveSpace** | ❌ No PCB support              | Mainly for mechanical design and 3D modeling.                   |
| **OpenSCAD**   | ❌ No PCB support              | Only supports 3D modeling, but can create enclosure designs.    |
| **FreeCAD**    | ✅ Limited (via PCB Workbench) | Works with KiCad for full PCB design (mechanical + electrical). |


### Cross-Platform Compatibility
> SolveSpace, OpenSCAD, FreeCAD

| Software       | Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) | Windows 11       | Notes                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SolveSpace** | ✅ Native support    | ✅ Native support | Lightweight, portable, runs well on both platforms                         |
| **OpenSCAD**   | ✅ Native support    | ✅ Native support | Identical interface and behavior across OSes                               |
| **FreeCAD**    | ✅ Native support    | ✅ Native support | Full functionality on both, though some GPU drivers can affect performance |

### unfolded 2D representations of 3D models
> often referred to as developing or unwrapping the surface of a 3D shape

| Software       | 3D Parabolic Modeling | 2D Unfolding / Flattening     | Export Options | Suitable for                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **FreeCAD**    | ✅                     | ✅ (Sheet Metal Workbench)     | DXF            | Affordable, open-source, good for mechanical designs |
| **Blender**    | ✅                     | ✅ (UV Unwrap for 2D patterns) | DXF, SVG       | Best for artistic, non-engineering use               |
| **SolidWorks** | ✅                     | ✅ (Sheet Metal)               | DXF            | Industry standard, expensive but precise             |
